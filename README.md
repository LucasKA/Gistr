Gistr: A quick and usable Gist creator for Brackets.io
===

A simple brackets extension to easily create a Github Gist from the current text selection.

This extenstion is built off of David Deraedt's ["To Gist"](https://github.com/davidderaedt/togist) extension, but with improved functionality and updated UX.

- Uses Brackets.io Modals intstead of JS Alert boxes
- Names the file the same as the file you pulled the text from
- Easy to copy the gist location to your clipboard
- Optionally open the gist in your browser


Usage
===
Select some text, and then select "Create Gist" from the Edit menu.
A modal should appear allowing you to Copy to Clipboard, or open the Gist in your default browser.

Known issues
===
- Description and filename not currently editable
- Anonymous Gists only right now

To Do
===
- Contextual menu activation will be the next update
- Allowing gists to your account will be considered, would love some help on that.
