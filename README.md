Gistr: A quick and usable Gist creator for Brackets.io
===

A simple brackets extension to easily create an anonymous Github Gist from the current text selection.

This extenstion is based off of David Deraedt's ["To Gist"](https://github.com/davidderaedt/togist) extension, but with much improved functionality and updated UX.

- Uses Brackets.io Modals intstead of JS Alert boxes
- Names the file the same as the file you pulled the text from
- Easy to copy the gist location to your clipboard
- Optionally open the gist in your browser
- Contextual menu activation within the editor


Usage
===
Select some text, and then select "Create Gist" from the Edit menu, or optionally, right click on the selected text and choose "Create Gist" from the contextual menu
A modal should appear allowing you to Copy to Clipboard, or open the Gist in your default browser.

Known issues
===
- Description and filename not currently editable
- Anonymous Gists only right now

To Do
===
- Integrate the Gist API and allow you to completely manage your Gists from inside Brackets

Please feel free to fork and help with the integration of API!! I'd love to work on it together
